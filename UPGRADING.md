# Upgrading

ðŸ‘‰ Keep the application files updated. You can update either by:

* Using the built-in updater at `/dashboard` > Click **check for updates**
* Downloading a [Release](https://github.com/rodber/chevereto-free/releases) and **Extract to** the application filesystem
* (Docker) Re-creating the container based in our [updated image](https://github.com/rodber/chevereto-free/pkgs/container/chevereto-free)

## Upgrade to Paid

ðŸ¤‘ To upgrade to paid:

* Purchase a [Chevereto License](https://chevereto.com/pricing) (if you don't have one already ðŸ’–)
* Upload the [latest release](https://chevereto.com/panel/downloads) package to your server (usually in the `public_html` folder)
* Unzip the software using your server built-in `unzip` utility
* Remove the `.zip` file
* Open your website at `/install`
